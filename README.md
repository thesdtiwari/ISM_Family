### Tech Used
1. HTML,CSS,JavaScript,Bootstrap for front-end.

### Working
Takes data of the individual that they provide from the form and stores them in firebase real-time database, whereas image of the individual is uploaded to the firebase storage with the help of multer and its url is added in real-time database.For displaying members it traverse through the database and according to their state/branch/club it displays in their respective pages.Whereas events section is hardcoded for respective state/branch/club page.
